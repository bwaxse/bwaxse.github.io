I am a Clinical Fellow in the [NIAID](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/)/[CNH](https://www.childrensnational.org/) Combined Medicine-Pediatrics Infectious Diseases Fellowship. In the [NHGRI Center for Precision Health Research](https://www.genome.gov/about-nhgri/Division-of-Intramural-Research/Center-for-Precision-Health-Research) under the mentorship of [Josh Denny](https://www.genome.gov/staff/Joshua-Denny-MD-MS) my research is focused on Electronic Health Record (EHR)-discovery methods in infectious diseases. We primarily conduct research-grade EHR phenotyping, phenome-wide, and genome-wide association studies. I am currently using these methods to investigate host-pathogen and host-environment interactions that govern differential susceptibility to seasonal respiratory infections as a model of episodic disease.
